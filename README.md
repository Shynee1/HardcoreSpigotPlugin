# HardcoreSpigotPlugin
This is the ULTIMATE Hardcore plugin for Spigot servers.
It was built from the ground up with large-scale smps in mind, although it works just great on smaller servers.

It has many features that I believe enhance the Minecraft Hardcore experience, such as lightning strikes on player death and easy use whitelisting when a player dies.

I think you will find that this plugin has everything you need for an ultimate hardcore experience, 
and if you have any questions/concerns you can join our discord. https://discord.gg/ayv5gXU9sU

Features:
- Puts dead players into spectator mode
- Spawns lightning on player death (configurable)
- Spawns a zombie with the player's head on player death (configurable)
- Has Discord Integration (see below)
- Allows spectators to easily teleport using /teleport (configurable)

Discord Integration:
I have added discord integration to this plugin. 
It can be turned off in the config if you do not want it. 
Using "!whitelist add", players can add themselves to a list of names. 
The first player in the list gets whitelisted when another player dies. 
Admins and mods can remove players from the list and see how many people are in the list.
Use "!whitelist help" to see a full list of commands.

Setup:
To use the plugin without discord integration, run the server, go into the config.yml, and change “whitelist” from true to false. 
To use with discord integration, follow this guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qWs3M-2j3061bmvbBR75kZvd2fF5mQZpHM5AqghOD8Q/edit?usp=sharing
